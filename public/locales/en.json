  "faq.a1": "Only verified guests with an active booking can access your property information. Guests must verify their phone number matches a current reservation before the AI shares any sensitive details like door codes or WiFi passwords. <a href=\"#security\">Learn more about our security measures →</a>",
  "faq.q2": "What if the AI gives incorrect information?",
  "faq.a2": "The AI only responds with information you've provided in your property profile. It won't make things up. For questions it can't answer, it politely tells guests to contact you directly. You're always in control of what information is shared.",
  "faq.q3": "How does booking sync work? Is it secure?",
  "faq.a3": "We use read-only iCal calendar feeds from Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com. This only syncs booking dates and guest names — we never have access to your platform login, account settings, or payment information. Your credentials stay completely separate. <a href=\"#integrations\">See supported integrations →</a>",
  "faq.q4": "Do guests need to download an app?",
  "faq.a4": "No. Guests simply scan a QR code with their phone camera and the chat opens instantly in their mobile browser. No app download, no account creation — it just works.",
  "faq.q5": "What happens to guest data after checkout?",
  "faq.a5": "Guest chat conversations are automatically deleted after their checkout date. We don't store personal data longer than necessary, and guests can request deletion at any time. We're fully GDPR and CCPA compliant. <a href=\"/privacy\">Read our Privacy Policy →</a>",
  "faq.q6": "Can I customize what the AI says?",
  "faq.a6": "Yes! You control all the information in your property profile — house rules, check-in instructions, local recommendations, appliance guides, and more. The AI uses exactly what you provide to give personalized, accurate responses. <a href=\"#features\">Explore all features →</a>",
  "faq.q7": "How many properties can I add?",
  "faq.a7": "Unlimited. Whether you have 1 property or 100, the price is the same — $5.99/month. Each property gets its own set of QR codes and customized AI responses. <a href=\"#pricing\">View pricing details →</a>",
